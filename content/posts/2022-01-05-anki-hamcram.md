This is an Anki deck I made for memorising everything you need to know to pass the NZ Amateur Radio license test. The questions/answers were all pulled from the public-domain list that is maintained on the NZART page.

You can [download](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/169904027) the deck from the AnkiWeb page.
