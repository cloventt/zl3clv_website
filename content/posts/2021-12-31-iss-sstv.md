I've been recently getting into amateur radio, and one of my goals was to do some amateur radio stuff involving satellites. Luckily the International Space Station frequently runs amateur radio events where they broadcast SSTV images.

## What is SSTV?
Slow-scan television is a protocol for sending images over radio. The "slow" part comes because the data rate is quite low - you might only get one full frame in a minute or two. It's popular in the amateur radio world as a way to make contacts without using your voice.

## Finding the ISS
The first thing you need for pulling down images from the ISS is... the ISS! The International Space Station is in low-earth orbit, meaning that flyovers only last a few minutes at a time (in my case, just over 7 minutes). This means you need to know when to get outside with a radio.

Unfortunately most ISS-spotting apps seem to be focussed on people visually spotting the ISS. This means they usually only tell you when the ISS is flying over at night. Radio works regardless of the time of day, so I needed to find an app that let me detect the ISS at any time. The website [heavens-above](https://www.heavens-above.com/PassSummary.aspx?satid=25544&lat=0&lng=0&loc=Unspecified&alt=0&tz=UCT) is a good place to look, though the interface is a bit clunky. In my case, I'd prefer to have something I can refer to on my phone, so I went looking for an app. I went through a few before I found [ISS Detector](https://twitter.com/issdetector). It has versions for both Android and iOS, and it allows you to track the ISS even when it isn't visible. It even supports tracking other amateur radio satellites for a small fee.

Whatever app you use, find the next time the ISS is flying over, and make sure you can get outside whenever that is happening. It also helps to check which direction it will be rising in and where it will set, so you know roughly where to point your radio.

It's also important to remember that the ISS doesn't broadcast SSTV constantly. The events are run by [ARISS](https://www.ariss.org/); check their website to see when transmissions are happening.

## Listening to the ISS
Once you've found the ISS, you'll need some equipment to listen to it. In my case, I used my [HanRongDa HRD-737](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=HanRongDa+HRD-737). This is a small wide-band receiver you can buy from Aliexpress for less than NZD$50. Because it supports VHF, it's fine for this particular application.

The SSTV signal is broadcast on 145.800 MHz FM. Simply switch your receiver to VHF and tune to this frequency, and keep a close ear out for the signal. I found I had to do a bit of a dance to get the signal to be picked up strongly, but once you've got it tuned and pointed in the right direction it will be fairly easy to follow.

{{<notice tip>}}
Don't point your antenna _at_ the satellite. Instead, it works best to angle the antenna so it is perpendicular to the ISS, so the antenna can pick up the maximum amount of RF energy.
{{</notice>}}

When you get the angle right, you'll hear a fairly loud sound from the radio, similar to a siren in some ways. This is the SSTV signal.

If you tune in and don't hear it at first: don't panic. There is a minute or two of dead air between transmissions. If they're broadcasting and the ISS is above you, you should hear something eventually.

## Decoding the Signal
There are a bunch of ways to decode an SSTV signal - ultimately it's just audio. If you can record the audio on your phone, there are PC apps that can be used to decode it. In my case I wanted to decode it directly on my phone, so I bought the [SSTV Slow Scan TV](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sstv-slow-scan-tv/id387910013) app for iOS. This app listens to the microphone input and decodes the signal into an image in realtime, so you can see how it looks as it decodes. The app is a little old and clunky, but it does work. You'll need to set the SSTV Mode to `PD 120`; this is what the ISS uses to broadcast.

{{<notice tip>}}
Go to _Setup_ in the app and toggle on `Auto Save` and `Save to Photos`. I lost my clearest image because I changed app for a brief second and the app reset without saving anything. With these two options toggled, the images go straight to your Photos app and will be backed up to iCloud automatically.

To decode the signal, just get your phone's microphone (at the bottom) really close to the speaker on the radio. If the signal is clear enough, you should see it begin decoding in realtime.

## Improving Image Quality
In my case I found that the images had a lot of noise (which shows up as green lines). This is due to two things:

1. The signal strength dropping off as the satellite moves relative to the antenna.
2. Ambient audio being picked up by the microphone.

Eliminating #1 is not easy: you just have to do your best to keep the antenna in clear view of wherever the satellite is, and angled in a way that picks up the signal the best.

To solve #2 I rigged up a crazy cable contraption that consists of:

* 3.5mm to 3.5mm auxiliary audio cable
* 3.5mm to 7mm instrument cable adapter
* an Amplitube iRig[^1]
* a Lightning audio dongle

[^1]: The iRig is a dongle for plugging a guitar into a phone. I've had mine for ages, and knockoff ones can be bought very inexpensively. There are probably other ways to do this as well.

One end plugs into the radio, and the other plugs into the phone. The phone then reads the signal from the cable as if it was an inline mic, eliminating the issue of ambient noise getting in the way. I got my clearest signals with this setup.

Getting a full image is not easy! There's an element of chance to it. You need the image to be transmitted in it's entirety, ideally right in the middle of the flyover. In most cases I only picked up a partial images as the broadcast was partway through when the satellite crossed the horizon.

## The Results
I pulled down some images! One of them was absolutely perfect, but sadly the app didn't save it for me. The ones I did save are below. I'm already looking forward to the next event, with the goal of capturing an entire set.
