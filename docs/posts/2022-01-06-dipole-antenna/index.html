      <h1>Dipole Antenna for Shortwave Listening</h1>
      <p>I&rsquo;m pretty notorious for jumping around between hobbies. I&rsquo;ll normally stick to one for a few months and then drop it, only to circle back around to it a few years later. One hobby I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated with but never actually got stuck into is amateur radio. At the moment I&rsquo;m gearing up towards getting my General Amateur Operatorâ€™s Certificate of Competency so I can get on the air (I&rsquo;ve had some pretty amazing help from the Christchurch branch of the NZART and I&rsquo;m hoping to achieve that goal in the next few weeks).</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&rsquo;ve been absorbing everything I can about how radio works. The beauty of radio is that you can learn an awful lot about it without needing a license, as long as you&rsquo;re happy just to receive. Last time I considered having a stab at this hobby I picked up a HanRongDa HRD-737 wide-band receiver, and I&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun with it just tuning around the bands. I think it cost me about NZD$50 from <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=HanRongDa+HRD-737">AliExpress</a>. You get what you pay for though; while it&rsquo;s fine for picking up broadcast music radio - as well as air-band and even VHF - it was absolutely hopeless at picking up shortwave signals. I&rsquo;ll include a video review from todderbert below in case you&rsquo;re interested in buying one (I recommend it if you just want to see what&rsquo;s out there but not for anything more serious).</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>I live in New Zealand, and sadly that means we&rsquo;re a long way from anyone that broadcasts on shortwave. If I got the antenna in <em>just</em> the right place and squinted <em>just</em> right the HRD-737 could sometimes pick up broadcasts from China, but they were never anything but a wash of noise and nowhere near intelligible. If I used the clip-on wire antenna that came with the receiver I could sometimes pick up a wee bit more, but nothing was particularly clear. So it seemed obvious I needed a larger antenna.</p>
<p>Generally the advice seems to be <em>&ldquo;just use whatever random length of wire you can get&rdquo;</em>. For me this was a bit of a challenge. My house is on the smaller side, and my property isn&rsquo;t huge either. Me entire property is only about 20m on it&rsquo;s longest side, and the house itself is a little over 12m on it&rsquo;s longest side. Add to that my wife&rsquo;s reluctance to let me hang visible wires all over the property or put up a pole and suddenly my options were getting pretty limited. But where there&rsquo;s a will there&rsquo;s a way, and where there&rsquo;s 12m of clear space up in my roof space there&rsquo;s a way to have an antenna.</p>
<p>After a bit of reading online I settled on a dipole antenna, mostly because it seemed like a fun project. A 12m run of wire will probably work well too but I learned much more about antennas by designing a dipole than I did from just putting up a long wire. A 12m antenna puts me somewhere in the middle of the popular SW bands, especially the ones that are most-used at night. As I only really get time to do my hobbies in the late evening, this seemed like a good choice.</p>
<p>Given that the antenna was going in the attic, I was able to get away with just using 18AWG speaker cable that I sourced from <a href="https://www.jaycar.co.nz/heavy-duty-speaker-cable-30m-roll/p/WB1709">Jaycar</a>. This probably wouldn&rsquo;t survive long outdoors but in the relatively static enviroment of my roof-space I think it will last a long time. To feed the antenna I decided to use 50Î© coax so that I could have an unbalanced but shielded feed-line. My thinking was that the shielded feed-line would help reduce RF interference from all the gadgets in the house, especially given that the antenna was going to be indoors. But this then presented a new challenge: how to connect unbalanced coax to a balanced dipole antenna?</p>
<p>The answer is of course a balun. Generally, the impedance of a dipole at the feed point is somewhere between 50Î© and 75Î© (depending on how high it is off the ground). My antenna is only going to be less than 5m off the ground, so it&rsquo;s probably closer that the 75Î© range. The signal loss from a 75Î© RX antenna to 50Î© coax is not something I&rsquo;m going to be losing sleep over, and I&rsquo;m happy that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; that I don&rsquo;t need to change the impedance. That means all I really need is a 1:1 balun to connect the antenna to the coax, and I should be sweet.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, a 1:1 balun is pretty easy to make. There&rsquo;s an absolutely fantastic guide by VK6YSF that you can look at <a href="https://vk6ysf.com/balun_guanella_current_1-1.htm">here</a>. Basically the balun consists of paired wires wrapped around a toroid. Better yet, VK6YSF is in Australia, so I was able to directly buy all the exact parts listed in the guide directly from Jaycar. While my son was down for a nap on Christmas Day, I slipped out to the shed and managed to get everything assembled. I initially built one using green electrical tape as insulation, but as the guide called for using teflon thread-seal tape I decided to make another one that way. The one using teflon is what ultimately ended up in the roof.</p>
<div
  class="notice"

  <span
    class="notice__title"
  ></span><div class="notice__content">
    I think the teflon only really matters if the balun is used for transmitting, as teflon is good at resisting high temperatures. These things can probably get a bit warm once a few watts are pumping through them. For receiving though it probably doesn&rsquo;t matter, but I figured I may as well use the one capable of transmitting.

<p>I waited for a cool day and dragged myself up a ladder into the roof. As I mentioned, my house is not that big, so the roof space can be a little cramped. Once I&rsquo;d figured out how to get around up there, it only took me about half an hour to put the antenna up. I&rsquo;d bought some nail-in cable clips (<a href="https://www.jaycar.co.nz/cable-clips-7-10mm-expandable-pk-25/p/HP0694">these ones</a>) but they ended up being totally useless - the weight of the cable just pulled them straight out of our rimu top chords. Instead I used zip ties, wrapped around the frames. This ended up being better for another reason: I was able to separate the cable slightly from the frame of the house.</p>

<p>Finally, I connected my length of coax to the balun and ran that down to the spare room. To connect it to the radio, I initially just used a wire with alligator clips at each end, attached to the antenna of the HRD-737. Suddenly the sensitivity seemed to jump right up. Success! I could hear a much wider range of stations across all bands, especially just after sunset. However, most of the stations were still very noisy with a lot of fading. Luckily I&rsquo;d anticipated this and made another purchase in the meantime.</p>
<p>Enter the Tecsun PL-310ET shortwave radio. At under NZD$100, including shipping from Australia, it seemed like a worthy upgrade to the HRD-737. Importantly, it has a dedicated antenna plug, meaning it can be connected directly to the antenna without the need for alligator clips. I soldered together a harness from a female banana socket to the tip of a 3.5mm mono audio cable, and this was good enough to get the connection through to the radio. The PL-310ET is a much more capable radio, with a huge list of features compared to the HRD-737. As always toddebert has a great review of it where he covers the important things.</p>

    I soon realised I&rsquo;d made a mistake with my harness. The signal improved a massive amount when I connected the ring of the 3.5mm TRS connector to the sleeve of the PL-259 on the coax. As soon as that connection was made, I was suddenly able to clearly hear stations from all over Asia and America.
  </div>
</div>

<p>So far I&rsquo;ve mostly picked up Chinese SW broadcasts in a variety of languages, but I&rsquo;ve also received a few stations from other interesting places:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taiwan</li>
<li>North Korea</li>
<li>Japan</li>
<li>Hawaii</li>
<li>Guam</li>
<li>North America (barely)</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course, I&rsquo;ve even managed to collect the venerable Radio New Zealand. This is one of the more interesting contacts: in theory I am inside the skip zone for the RNZ shortwave broadcast. But, I was able to pick it up very clearly for about 15 minutes during sunset.</p>
<p>The antenna is also really effective for standard broadcast AM and FM. I can pick up any station in Christchurch with no difficulty, and have even picked up FM stations from as far afield as Cheviot - a distance of 130km!</p>
<p>A crucial resource in all of this is <a href="https://short-wave.info">short-wave.info</a> which is a fantastic resource for determining what&rsquo;s on the air when you&rsquo;re listening. So far I&rsquo;ve only really had time to listen during my evening, so next I&rsquo;ll be tuning around sometime during the day if I ever get time. I currently have an RTL-SDR in the mail, so I&rsquo;m planning to hook that up to the antenna and make it accessible with OpenWebRX so that I can do SWL from my phone - even on my lunch break at the office.</p>
